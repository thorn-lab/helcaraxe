A variety of commercially available screens such as Crystal Screen HT, Index HT (Hampton Research, USA), Morpheus and PGA (Molecular Dimensions, UK) were used in 96 well MRC crystallization plates (Molecular Dimensions, UK). All screening trials contained 400 nanolitre drops, each mixed in a 1 to 1 ratio of the protein and the screen solutions. The crystallization trials were incubated at 293K. 
The different leads obtained from the crystallization screening trials were optimised by determining working phase diagrams as detailed in Saridakis and Chayen (Saridakis & Chayen 2000). Each optimisation trial was also scaled up to 1 microlitre drop volume and set up manually in hanging drops (Qiagen Nextal plates) and in microbatch experiments (Chayen 1999).",293,"2018-05-17","6GJT","1.98",36.304,0.2922,0.2731,,0.27407,1.98,124208,"MOLECULAR REPLACEMENT",
