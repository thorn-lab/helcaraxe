hanging drop vapor diffusion method using a 4 uL drop that contained 
equal amounts of protein and reservoir solution. Each well contained 
a reservoir solution (500 uL) of 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.4, 23%

crystals. In this case, crystal trays were set up as described above and 
incubated for 24 hours. The flat sheet crystals were collected and 
treated with seed beads using a kit from Hampton Research. A 
4 uL drop containing flat sheet crystals was added to a tube containing 
seed beads. Reservoir solution 
(10 uL) was pipetted on the cover slide to remove all crystals from the 
coverslip, and the procedure was repeated five times. The resulting mixture 
of crystals and seed beads was vortexed for 30 seconds and cooled on ice for 
10 seconds, and the procedure was repeated six times. Serial dilutions of the 
treated crystals were set up from 10-1 to 10-3, and 0.5 uL of the 10-2 dilution 
crystal seeds was added into the drops of the 24-hour crystal tray. Larger
