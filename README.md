# Helcaraxe
"The second element in Helkarakse is said to be the Quenya word karakse ("jagged hedge of spikes"). Helge Fauskanger has suggested that the first element (hel-) derives from the root KHELEK ("ice")." -http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Helcarax%C3%AB

The project aims to find ice-rings in protein diffraction data which are visible as "spikes" in plots of structure factor or observed intensity versus resolution.
