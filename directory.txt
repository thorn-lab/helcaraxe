#NAMING CONVENTIONS
evaluation_table -> results of evaluation of through
master 		-> complete preprocessed version
binplots 	-> NumPy array which holds the 2D histograms
array 		-> pandas DataFrame holding metadata + labels(accesable ["Ice-Ring])
train 		-> training set(:len(X)*0.8) and validation set(len(X)*0.8:)
Fobs/Iobs	-> histograms have been generated only out of the named value
unstandardized 	-> Not standardized data (raw histograms, were only used for EDA), default is standardized
cleaned 		-> Bad data has been removed.

#FOLDER
arrays: 		.pkl and .npy files which hold data read by the scripts

files: 		.csv and .xlsx files which hold to human readable data

stats: 		evaluation results, pictures, files used for BachelorThesis

Helcaraxe_exe:	contains the final models, deployable script, auspex_ranges and some mtz to test

Env:		contains the environment in which Helcaraxe was developed

#.py
bad_data_finder:		prototype of the discriminator function (detects cut out resolution ranges)

sheet_cleaner: 		used to clean to initial label_sheets(output: cleaned_test/train .xlsx files)

terminal_mtz_getter: 	downloads mtz files from AUSPEX server, needs VPN (not recommended, use CCP4)

mtz_reader: 		reads mtz and cleaned_test/train files, outputs the master array

labeler: 		tool to annonate data easily.

evaluate_model: 		evaluates models, produces the evaluation_tables

see_eva: 		script to inspect classifications

model_builder.ipynb: 	Jupiter Notebook used to build, fit and evaluate model
